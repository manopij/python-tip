#A set is an unordered collection with no duplicate elements
#Set objects also support mathematical operations like union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference

basket = {'apple', 'orange', 'apple', 'pear', 'orange', 'banana'}

# show that duplicates have been removed
print(basket) 

# fast membership testing
print('orange' in basket) #True
print('crabgrass' in basket) #False

# Demonstrate set operations on unique letters from two words
a = set('abracadabra')
b = set('alacazam')

# unique letters in a
print(a)

# letters in a but not in b
print(a-b)

# letters in a or b or both
print(a|b)

# letters in both a and b
print(a&b)

# letters in a or b but not both

#Similarly to list comprehensions, set comprehensions are also supported
